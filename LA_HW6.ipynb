    "For $w=1.1$ convergence speed is high. We could observe, that decay rate converges to spectral radius of $p(B_{SOR})$. But this happens only from 4th iteration onwards. Till iteration 4, decay rate fluctuates and eventually converges to spectral radius. From decay rate we could judge that overall convergens speed for SOR method is higher that for Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods under same conditions $p(B_{SOR})<p(B_{GS})<p(B_j)$. Also, worth to mentioned that solution retrieved by SOR method with $w=1.1$ is closer to true value after 10 iterations compare to Jacobi and GS methods.\n",
